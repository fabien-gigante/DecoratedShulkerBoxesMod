# Decored Shulker Boxes
Welcome to the *Decored Shulker Boxes* Minecraft mod.

Too many shulker boxes in your inventory or ender chest ? Always confusing them ? Not enough colors available in vanilla Minecraft to distinguish them easily ? Need to customize further their appearance ? Look no further !

Simply combine a shulker box with two dyes (instead of a single one) in your craft. The resulting dyed shulker box will have both colors. The primary dye determines its lid color, the secondary dye its base color. That's it !

# Decored Shulker Boxes
Welcome to the *Decored Shulker Boxes* Minecraft mod.

Too many shulker boxes in your inventory or ender chest ? Always confusing them ? Not enough colors available in vanilla Minecraft to distinguish them easily ? Need to customize further their appearance ? Look no further !

Simply combine a shulker box with two dyes (instead of a single one) in your craft. The resulting dyed shulker box will have both colors. The primary dye determines its lid color, the secondary dye its base color. 
Both colors are removed when the shulker box is washed in a water cauldron.

Use an anvil to forge an arbitrary item into the shulker box's lid acting as an icon label for the box. Items forged into shulker boxes are consumed in the process, but can also be removed from their box and recovered using an anvil as well.
